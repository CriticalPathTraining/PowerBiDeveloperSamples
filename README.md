# Power BI Developer Samples
A set of sample Visual Studio projects created by Ted Pattison of Critical Path Training which demonstrate how to extend the Power BI environment using custom development.

## PowerBiRestApiDemo
This is the traditional 'hello world' demo which uses a Console application to connect to the Power BI service and to call to the Power BI REST API to create a simple dataset with two tables.


## CampaignContributions
This sample project used a Console application to call to the Power BI REST API to create and continually update a dataset with campaign contributions. This dataset can be used to create reports and real-time dashboards that are updated in real-time as data arrives.


## PowerBiContentViewer
This sample projects demonstrates how to develop a single page application (SPA) which programs against the Power BI REST API. The project is built using JavaScript together with the Angular-JS framework and the Active Directory Authentication Library for JavaScript (ADAL-JS) which is what Microsoft recommends for building client-side applications that authenticate against Azure Active Directory. The purpose of this sample application is to demonstrate the programming techniques required to embed reports and dashboard tiles from the Power BI service into an external web site.
